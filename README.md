## Getting Started

You will need Processing. I also recommend a good programming code editor.

### Prerequisites

Get Processing [here](https://processing.org/download/).

You can run and edit the project without any special text editor and solely use Processing.
However, the built-in editor has almost no keyboard shortcuts and if you want to program something really quick
(and maybe want to have a specific color scheme), you should use a proper code editor.

The code editor I recommend: [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
If you use Sublime Text for this project, I highly recommend to install `Package Control`
and (using Package Control) installing the plugin `Processing`.
This way you can run the Processing sketch right from Sublime Text (using `CTRL`+`B`).

Other, usable code editors:
* [Text Mate](https://macromates.com/) (Mac OS only)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows only)

### Installing

Download or clone this repo. Unpack it (if you downloaded it).

Inside the repo open the file `BenjaminProgramming.pde` using Processing.

You can run the Processing sketch right away (by pressing the play button in the main window) or
Start reading the tutorial inside the sketch.

## Built With

* [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - The code editor I use
* [Processing](https://processing.org/) - The project without this would be impossible

## Contributing

Open an issue if you want to help or have questions.

### Roadmap
Things I already plan to implement, but didn't have yet:
- [] Demo code for all basic Processing features
- [] Demo code for every language feature
- [] A website (GitHub Pages) to acompany the comments in the sketch file

### Project History
This project was created because I (Max) was asked by my nephew to teach him programming. I "taught" him Python
first, but this was a mistake in many ways: 1.: There was no easy way too make something visual, therefore no
fast reward cycle. 2.: I explained it way to fast, with no focus and o clear line where we're heading.
The result was that he understood nothing, forgot everything and I thought I don't know how to explain something.
Using Processing as first experience is the much better approach, because it immediately enables
visual feedback and interactivity and is actually Java (a language he said he wanted to learn). We will see
if the "comment everything and let the student read a lot" approach is better.
